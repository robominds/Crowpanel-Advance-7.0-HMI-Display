// The STC8H1K28 companion microcontroller at I2C 0x30.
//
// On this board the backlight is NOT on a GPIO. An MT9201 boost is driven by a
// second microcontroller, and you turn the backlight on by sending it an I2C
// command. The same part owns the GT911's reset line, the buzzer, the
// amplifier's mute, and the battery charger's status lines.
//
// The command encoding INVERTED between board revisions:
//
//   V1.2    0x10 = on (brightest), 0x05 = off.   Touch activation: 0x19
//   V1.3+   0 = brightest, 244 = dimmest,        Touch activation: 250
//           245 = off. Writing 255 is out of range, not bright.
//
// Writes are a single bare byte with no register address.
//
// Getting this wrong produces a black screen with no error, no serial
// complaint, and a correctly scanning panel behind it - which reads as a dead
// board. Since the revision is printed on the silkscreen and the board has not
// arrived, begin() probes: it tries the V1.3+ encoding first, falls back to
// V1.2, and reports which answered.
//
// Once the revision is known, set CROWPANEL_ADVANCE_REV in board_pins.h and
// this probing can be deleted.
//
// The part is a black box. Elecrow publish no source and no register
// specification, its behaviour changed between revisions, and it is not
// reflashable through the ESP32. Do not probe undefined command bytes to
// discover the rest of its table; Elecrow advise against it and there is no way
// to undo a mistake.
