// Panel bring-up for the Elecrow CrowPanel Advance 7.0-HMI.
//
// Wraps the 800x480 16-bit RGB565 IPS panel in a LovyanGFX device and hands
// LVGL 9 a pair of PSRAM draw buffers.
//
// This driver does NOT own the backlight. On this board the backlight is an
// I2C command to a companion microcontroller; see panel_mcu.h. Elecrow's own
// driver has the LovyanGFX Light_PWM block commented out for the same reason.
//
// Every pin, timing and clock value comes from board_pins.h. Nothing here
// hardcodes a GPIO number.
